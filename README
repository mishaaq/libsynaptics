PURPOSE:
    libsynaptics is intended to support all upcoming driver versions of the
    Xorg Synaptics Touch Pad Driver [1].
    Programs that want to access the touch pad should make use of this library
    and will thereby not interfere with each other.
    Available parameters can be read and written and the version of the 
    installed driver can be determined.
    It is still not clear whether libsynaptics will be distributed seperately or
    within the driver package (which seems to be the better solution to me! )
    
    Future releases of QSynaptics and KSynaptics [3] are planned to rely on libsynaptics.

LICENSE:
    GPL version 2 [2]

USAGE:
    As for now libsynaptics is distributed seperately, you need to install it manually.
    If you want to write a C++ program that uses libsynaptics you need to include <synaptics.h>
    (in /usr/include/synaptics/synaptics.h)
    The delivered "padtest.cpp" is an easy example how to make use of the library.

PREREQUISITES:
    Xorg Synaptics Driver Version 0.14.4 or above [1]

INSTALLATION:
    Unpack the tar ball.
    First, uninstall any previously installed version by running "make uninstall".
    Run "make" and "make install". 
    You're done!

    FROM SVN:

    RUN
      aclocal
      autoconf
      automake
      ./configure --prefix=/usr
      make
      (sudo) make install

    DONE!

TESTING AND BUG REPORTS:
    "make test" creates a simple regression test. If the test detects bugs (wrong parameters),
    a tar "buginfo.tar.gz" is created that contains the necessary information for me to 
    investigate the problem.
    Please mail any of those tar balls and other kind of bug reports to katakombi@web.de
